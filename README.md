# MVP

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

## Features

- logs_visualizing: I integrated [keithjjones/visualize_logs](https://github.com/keithjjones/visualize_logs) into the MVP. This integration allows MVP to process CSV report files from Process Monitor and generate informative graphs. These graphs depict various details, such as Process ID (PID), child processes, etc., aiding in the malware analysis process.
- process_capturing: Using [Rurik/Noriben](https://github.com/Rurik/Noriben) to integrate [Process Monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) into the web application. This addition enables MVP to capture real-time computer process information and generate corresponding CSV reports. When combined with the logs_visualizing feature, this functionality facilitates the visualization of processes captured after the monitoring process.
