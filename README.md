“Making the invisible visible – Digital Sherlock Holmes for defensive security”

When it comes to malware analysis, the importance of visualisation cannot be overstated. Shifting through lines of code or raw data can be overwhelming, even for experienced experts. Visualisation takes this complex data and transforms it into intuitive, easily digestible graphics. This not only accelerates the analysis process but also makes it more accurate. Visual aids can help identify patterns, anomalies, and characteristics of malware that could easily be missed otherwise.

This brings us to our core project concept: Digital Sherlock Holmes. As modern-day digital detectives, we will use analytical and visualisation tools to dissect, understand, and ultimately combat malware effectively so that users can quickly grasp more information

## Features

- logs_visualizing: Integrated [keithjjones/visualize_logs](https://github.com/keithjjones/visualize_logs) into the MVP. This integration allows MVP to process CSV report files from Process Monitor and generate informative graphs. These graphs depict various details, such as Process ID (PID), child processes, etc., aiding in the malware analysis process.
- process_capturing: Using [Rurik/Noriben](https://github.com/Rurik/Noriben) to integrate [Process Monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) into the web application. This addition enables MVP to capture real-time computer process information and generate corresponding CSV reports. When combined with the logs_visualizing feature, this functionality facilitates the visualization of processes captured after the monitoring process.
- pcap_visualiser : Integrated [Pcapviz](https://github.com/1ultimat3/PcapViz) into MVP. The geographical dataset is updated from GeoIP to GeoIP2 to represent malware origin, showing diagrams of network topology(layer 2,3 and 4, showing deivce, data flow and IP, TDP/TCP respectively). User can select a combination of options as per their need

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

### Mandatory
